## Noisyloop

Engineer, full-stack developer, creator. 20+ years writing code across the full stack, from product interfaces down to the systems layer where most people stop looking.

AI for lab experiments + deeper understanding. I learn from the mistakes the LLM's make. Other labs (which I did not write about) are TryHackMe, HackTheBox, PortSwigger and more. This is essentially a research hub, but my write-ups don't include THM etc.

## Security Tooling

**[Glasswally](https://github.com/noisyloop/glasswally)**
Real-time LLM distillation attack detection via eBPF kernel uprobes.
Hooks into inference processes at the kernel boundary. Fingerprints query patterns. Alerts before a model theft completes. MITRE ATT&CK mapped.
`Rust` · `eBPF` · `Detection Engineering` · `AI Security`

---

**[ghostwire](https://github.com/noisyloop/ghostwire)**
Passive USB device fingerprinting and anomaly detection daemon.
Detects BadUSB implants, HID injection devices, and hardware anomalies at the enumeration layer — before the OS finishes booting the driver. Silent. Rust. No kernel module required.

---

**[Milly](https://github.com/noisyloop/milly)**
The first local LLM with a built-in security layer.
HMAC-signed memory. TF-IDF RAG. Air-gapped by design. Zero egress. 136 passing tests covering memory integrity, injection resistance, and audit logging.
`Python` · `Ollama` · `AI Security`

---

**[passive-intel](https://github.com/noisyloop/passive-intel)**
Passive threat-intel console for defenders. CISA KEV, URLhaus, and Feodo Tracker in one UI — actively exploited CVEs, live malware URLs, and botnet C2 IPs. No API keys. No cost. Includes a blocklist endpoint you can feed directly into nginx, ufw, or Cloudflare.
`JavaScript` · `OSINT` · `Threat Intel`

---

**[EverythingOS](https://github.com/noisyloop/everythingos)**
Security-first multi-agent framework for autonomous systems.
ModelGuard input/output validation. DecisionLedger audit trail. NIST AI RMF aligned. 81/81 tests passing, zero TypeScript errors. Built under the Robots For Peace framework.
`TypeScript` · `Autonomous Agents` · `AI Governance`
